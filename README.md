# Fruit-saga-game
This program uses mini-max algorithm along with alpha beta pruning to give the best move.

Project Description:
The	Fruit	Rage	is	a	two	player	game	in	which	each	player	tries	to	maximize	his/her	share	from a	batch	of	fruits	randomly	placed	in	a	box.	The	box	is	divided	into	cells	and	each	cell is either	empty	or filled	with one fruit of a	specific	type.	
	
At	the	beginning	of	each	game,	all	cells	are	filled	with	fruits.	Players	play	in	turn	and	can	pick a cell	of	the	box	in	their	own	turn	and	claim	all	fruit	of	the	same	type,	in	all	cells	that	are	connected	to	the	selected cell	through	horizontal	and	vertical	paths.	For	each	selection	or	move	the	agent is	rewarded	a	numeric	value	which	is the	square	of	the	number	of	fruits	claimed	in	that	move.	

Once	an	agent	picks	the	fruits	from	the	cells,	their	empty	place	will	be	filled	with	other	fruits	on	top	of	them	(which	fall	down	due	to	gravity),	if	any.	In	this	game,	no	fruit	is	added	during	game	play.	Hence,	players	play	until	all	fruits	have	been	claimed.
